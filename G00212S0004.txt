59.874650157401675	67.33404012353688	C1	Recently, I've been having trouble sleeping. And sometimes I feel a tightness in my chest.
67.61063299680775	73.10489162870684	C1	I also find myself constantly worrying about things that might go wrong,[N]

100.2854657157143	103.74721029820145	C1	but they only provide temporary rel- relief.
104.07148218317717	111.36042199787185	C1	I've also been on medication before, but I stopped taking it because I didn't like the side effects.

156.60594949521166	161.45343318579927	C1	How long does it usually take to see results with C B T?
